# BinarySearchTree
Binary Search Tree with a range min query function that works in O(logn) time 
and a different range min query function that works in O(n). 
My code reads an inputfile with the commands "IN key data" to insert, 
"RMQ key1 key2" to do the effecient query and "naiveRMQ key1 key2" to do the ineffecient query.
